        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Paper-thin veggies, a shower of herbs, a pile of fried crispy red curry rice, and a limey garlicky vinaigrette all over top. This crispy rice salad is all I want to eat right now!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>a 1/2-inch knob of fresh ginger, or a spoonful of ginger paste</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fish sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons avocado oil, or another neutral oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup lime juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon chili crisp </li>
            <li>2 cups cooked jasmine rice </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons avocado oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons red curry paste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch </li>
            <li>half an English cucumber</li>
            <li>1 shallot, thinly sliced or minced</li>
            <li>1 bunch cilantro, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 bunch mint, roughly chopped or torn </li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped peanuts</li>
            <li>chili crisp</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dressing: Blitz everything up in a blender or food processor to make this SUPER yummy, punchy sauce.</li>
            <li>Crispy Rice: Toss the rice in a bowl with the oil and curry paste. If it’s not sticking together when you squeeze it, add the cornstarch and get your hands wet to mix it again (this happens if the rice is pre-cooked or several days old). Squeeze it into loose, squishy chunks and transfer to the air fryer in a single layer. Air fry at 400 for 7-9 minutes, until golden and crisped. See Note 3 for alternative methods, I find the air fryer to be fastest and most convenient!</li>
            <li>You’re Done! Yum! Break the crispy rice apart into little golden, delightful chunks. Toss with about half of the dressing and however many veggies you want. Garnish it with some peanuts and chili crisp if you want. I mean, honestly. Wow. This is so good.</li>

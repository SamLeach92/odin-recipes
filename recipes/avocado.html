        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These Avocado Caesar Green Beans are some type of magic! Tender green beans, a zippy avocado caesar, and toasty panko all over top.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>half an avocado</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 large clove garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>12 ounces green beans</li>
            <li>Parmesan for topping</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the Avocado Caesar: Blitz everything in a small blender jar until smooth sauce / dressing forms. Taste and adjust (look out, it’s really good). If it’s too thick, add some extra water until it drizzles smoothly off the end of a spoon.</li>
            <li>Make the Panko Crispies: Mix panko, garlic powder, olive oil, and salt in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30 second increments, stirring after each one, until the panko starts to turn golden (about 2-3 minutes total). It’ll be very hot – be careful, don’t taste it yet.</li>
            <li>Cook the Green Beans: Boil green beans for 3-5 minutes until bright green. If you want to preserve the best color, drain and transfer to a bowl with ice water to shock the green beans and stop them from cooking further. Not necessary, but I do this sometimes because I like the very bright green!</li>
            <li>Assemble and Serve: Arrange the green beans on a platter, top with dollops of the avocado caesar, and sprinkles of panko crispies and grated Parmesan. (You’ll probably have a little bit of avocado caesar left which I never have any issues using up!) Add lemon zest, black pepper, or chili flakes if you want. Serve warm or cold with your favorite protein, and maybe a little extra sauce for dunking. So good!</li>
